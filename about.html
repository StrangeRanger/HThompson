            First off, hello, and welcome to my website. My name is Hunter, and
            I am currently a student at Eastern Washington University, majoring
            in Computer Science with a focus on Cyber Security and minoring in
            Communication. I am passionate about anything related to computers
            and technology, especially when it comes to software security. I
            love to make music, watch the ever-expanding vastness of space, and
            watch anime. Before I had decided to major in computer science, I
            had previously wanted to go into Astrophysics due to my love of
            space and physics.

            Initially, randomserver.xyz was a small project to help me learn and
            better understand how to create a website, use HTML and CSS, and set
            up a web server. Around 2019, I decided that I wanted this server to
            more than just a small project. Instead, it would be a repository of
            sorts where I could archive and share different things that I've
            created, found, like, and so on.
