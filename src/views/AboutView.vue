        text="First off, hello, and welcome to my website. My name is Hunter, and I am currently a
        student at Eastern Washington University, majoring in Computer Science with a focus on Cyber
        Security and minoring in Communication. I am passionate about anything related to computers
        and technology, especially when it comes to software security. I love to make music, watch
        the ever-expanding vastness of space, and watch anime. Before I had decided to major in
        computer science, I had previously wanted to go into Astrophysics due to my love of space
        and physics."

        title="What is this website, and what is its purpose?"
        text="Initially, hthompson.dev was a small project to help me learn and better understand
        how to create a website, use HTML and CSS, and set up a web server. Around 2019, I decided
        that I wanted this server to more than just a small project. Instead, it would be a
        repository of sorts where I could archive and share different things that I've created,
        found, like, and so on."
