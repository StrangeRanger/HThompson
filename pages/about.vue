          My name is Hunter, a Computer Science major specializing in Cyber Security at Eastern
          Washington University. My passion for computers and technology, particularly software
          security, drives my academic and professional goals. Beyond my core studies, I have a deep
          fascination with the infinite wonders of space, which once inspired me to consider a
          career in Astrophysics. I'm also an avid music enthusiast and enjoy immersing myself in
          the diverse worlds of anime.

      <v-expansion-panel title="What is this website and what is its purpose?">
        <v-expansion-panel-text>
          My journey with hthompson.dev, formerly known as randomserver.xyz, began as a simple
          project aimed at honing my skills in HTML and CSS. It was more than just about building a
          website; it was about mastering the intricacies of web server administration. In 2019, the
          site quickly transcended its initial purpose. It morphed into a dynamic repository where I
          could curate and showcase my creations, discoveries, and favorites.
          <br />
          The year 2023 marked a pivotal moment for the site. Faced with circumstances that
          necessitated a complete overhaul of my web server, I seized this challenge as an
          opportunity for reinvention. This led to a significant rebranding: transitioning from
          randomserver.xyz to hthompson.dev. Embracing this change, I redeveloped the main webpage
          with Vue.js, aligning the siteâ€™s aesthetic with a more professional outlook.
